Lab 5: Functions and Graphics

----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab, I have created a function that performs some primitive graphics operations on a small simulated display. These functions clear the entire display to a color, display a filled colored circle and display an unfilled colored circle using a memory-mapped bitmap graphics display by utilizing arrays, subroutines, macros, and the MIPS stack.
